      <p>
          
          Greg:
          -communication skills
            (read btw. lines)
            (listen to why theyre having a problem, not just "what" their problem is)
            (really listen to needs, not just tech talk)
          -handle stress
            ()
          -multitasking
          -sense of urgency/prioritization
            (understanding some things can wait, not walking in the room and blurting out problems)
            (bigger problem for javascript or html to be malfunctioning than css font)
          -conflict resolution

          Toni:

          Simon Sinek:
          -start with why
          -clarity, discipline, consistency (humble, approachable, )
          -following
          -not speaking, listening
          -serving those that serve others
