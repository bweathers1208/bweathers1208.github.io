          <h3>Professional Background</h3>
          <p>I've been a bartender for going on 10 years now, so I do pride myself on thinking independently, prioritizing my tasks and I tend to be hyper-focused on helping the people around me. No matter the industry, I have a high standard for effort, so before I enrolled in Ctrl+Shift Code School, I was training to become a Certified Bourbon Steward through the <a href="https://staveandthief.com" target="_blank">Stave & Thief</a> spirits training program available online. I once read somewhere, "It matters not what you do, only the integrity with which you do it," and that really has been a motto of mine ever since.<br>
          Although many think of bartending as "making drinks," it's really been a source of leadership training for me. Read more about my experiences as a bartender & how they've contributed to my leadership tendencies <a href="/blog/blogpost3.html">here.</a></p>
          <h3>Personal Background</h3>
          <p>I moved to Oklahoma as a military spouse, and although that marriage has since come to an end, I have learned that life has a funny way of putting a person right where they belong. Between the time I moved to Oklahoma, (December of 2015,) and October of 2019, Oklahoma has transformed for me from appearing to be an empty place of despair away from family and friends whose mere existence (and the fact that I had to live here) I vehemently resented, to becoming a source of strength and identity for me. I've made so many connections here in Oklahoma and explored so many passions during my time here that I never would've discovered otherwise.</p>
          <h3>Goals</h3>
          <p>My goal is to completely change my career path into being a full-time website coder/programmer.
          Currently I'm more drawn to front-end processes, but having barely begun to understand what the various avenues are I may change my mind in the future. My first micro-goal while I'm in the class is to completely immerse myself in the coding world the way I did in the dog world, so that it becomes habit to talk and think about these things instead of it being a chore I remind myself to do.</p>
