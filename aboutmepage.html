        <h3>Professional Background</h3>
                <p>Having been a bartender for ten years, I love the flexibility that web/software development brings to the table as a career. Although bartending will always have a special place in my heart, I'm excited to move into a career field that isn't as physically demanding day in and day out but still satsfies that curiosity bug.<br>
                <br>
                No matter the industry, I do believe in always remaining a student of your trade.<br> 
                Before I enrolled in Ctrl+Shift Code School, I was preparing to become a Certified Bourbon Steward through the <a href="https://staveandthief.com" target="_blank">Stave & Thief</a> spirits training program available online. I once read somewhere, "It matters not what you do, only the integrity with which you do it," and that really has been a motto of mine ever since.<br>
                Although many think of bartending as "just making drinks," it's really been a source of leadership training for me-- teaching me the importance of holding myself accountable, leading by example, setting myself and my coworkers up for success, and that I always have time to help someone who is drowning in the shift's chaos.<br>

          <h3>Personal Background</h3>
                <p>In 2015, I moved from Georgia to Oklahoma as a military spouse, leaving all of my family in my hometown. Although that marriage has since come to an end, I have learned that life has a funny way of putting a person right where they belong. In the four years I've lived here, Oklahoma has transformed from being a place of solitude and despair away from my first home, to now being a new source of strength, identity and belonging for me (partially because of Ctrl+Shift Code School).<br>
                As a military spouse who has always been a bit of a loner, I never truly identified with being a stereotypical "military spouse." Walking a bit more of an unbeaten path than most, and living in a completely new area of the country, I have now made so many personal connections here in Oklahoma and explored so many new activities-turned-passions that I never would've discovered otherwise. I am so thankful for the unexpected turn my life took, and I look forward to seeing where the road leads next.</p>
          <h3>Goals</h3>
                <p>As a member of the first cohort to pass through Ctrl+Shift Code School, I look forward to marketing myself as an official, newly-deemed web/software developer! Currently I'm more drawn to front-end processes, but having barely begun to understand what the various avenues are I may change my mind in the future.<br>
                My first micro-goal while I'm in the class is to completely immerse myself in the tech world, making connections and surrounding myself with other devs who share the same day-to-day frustrations and enjoyments that come with being a part of this industry.</p>
