        <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>So obviously my name is Bri, and my dogs are the center of my universe. There's no hiding it, I've come to terms with being "that girl." It's cool, it's fine, it's whatever. I'm from Augusta, GA-- yep, the land of the Master's, and -shameless plug- if anyone knows where I can find boiled peanuts in Oklahoma I will be your best friend forever! I do get along with humans as well, but most importantly to know about  me, I have a German Shepherd named Tanto, a Belgian Malinois named Dub, and a cat named Max who always looks angry in photos.</p><br>
          <h1>Goals</h1>
          <p>My goal is to completely change my career path into being a full-time website coder/programmer, and eventually work my way up in the industry to be a web developer.
          Currently I'm more drawn to front-end stuff, but having barely begun to understand what the various avenues are I may change that in the future. My first goal while I'm in the class is to completely immerse myself in the coding world the way I did in the dog world, so that it becomes habit to talk and think about these things instead of being a chore I remind myself to do.</p>
