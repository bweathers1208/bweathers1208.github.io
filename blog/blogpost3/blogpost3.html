  <h1>Intro to Web Development</h1>
<p>Web development is a subject that, if you’d asked me what I knew about it four months ago, I would’ve most likely stumbled to get out some form of, “it’s what those IT guys do in their nerd-dungeon in their mom’s basement, on the black screen with the green lettering, hacking into high-security databases and other stuff no one understands,” and for some reason the IT guy from Jurassic Park freaking out when the security is breached would inevitably come to mind:

<p>And, in some ways, I wouldn’t be entirely wrong. The main difference between my hypothetical answer and my actual answer, three weeks into a coding bootcamp/school, is the industry’s “real people” factor. I’ve always viewed IT/web design as something I could understand if I had dedicated my mind to it, but until recently I’d assumed it was boring and honestly out of “normal” people’s grasp. It always seemed to be something people set in their minds that they wanted to do at an early age, probably were teased all through school for their “nerdy” ways, dedicated their lives to computers, and never interacted with humans. And in some cases that may be true! But through this code school I’ve been realizing more each day that that is definitely not the rule (anymore, at least.) As computers and technology continue to become more mainstream and more essential to even conducting every day life, the demand for people that know how to troubleshoot these devices, problem-solve when they’re not working properly, and create new things for the devices to do is continually growing! (I mean, I thought I lost my phone two nights ago and was in a full-tilt panic because my phone is my alarm clock; it’s my contact point for 100% of my loved ones, some of which are local but most of which are not; it gives me directions when I drive; I am completely dependent on my phone for everyday actions!) And it’s more of a trade than it is a “degree-specific” job market, which really helps out when it comes to investment overhead aka student loans, etc., before getting a job.</p>
