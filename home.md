<h1>About Me</h1>
  <body>
   <p>My name is Bri. I call Georgia home, and I moved to Oklahoma as a military spouse. I have two dogs and a cat, and dog training is one of my main hobbies.<br>Currently I'm a bartender by trade who is loving learning how to code!</p>

  <h1>Goals</h1>
<p>My goal is to completely change my career path into being a full-time website coder/programmer, and eventually work my way up in the industry to be a web developer.
Currently I'm more drawn to front-end stuff, but having barely begun to understand what the various avenues are I may change that in the future.<br>My first goal while I'm in the class is to completely immerse myself in the coding world the way I did in the dog world, so that it becomes habit to talk and think about these things instead of being a chore I remind myself to do.</p>

      <h2><strong>How Dogsport Prepared Me For Learning How to Code</strong></h2>
<div></div>
<h4>What is Dogsport?</h4>
<p>In early 20th Century Germany, the German Shepherd Dog breed was invented and finalized by Max von Stephanitz along with the first official breed standard, or the ideal picture of the breed’s physical and temperamental specifications. Along with this, though, he created a breed suitability test called Schutzhund, (German for The Protection Dog,) comprised of three phases of competition and preceded by a separate temperament test. The idea was that only dogs that passed all of the phases of the test with confidence and a stable temperament would be suitable for breeding, in order to weed out those who were either unstable or untrainable, and ultimately keep all future German Shepherd Dogs true to the breed.<br>Schutzhund is still practiced around the world today and among the breed enthusiasts/responsible breeders, is still used as the breed standard by which dogs are judged. Passing the Schutzhund test is called “titling,” and while breeders participate in the sport to show their dogs’ capabilities as a way of holding themselves accountable, some enthusiasts like myself partake in the training as a way of forming a relationship with their dogs, and as a hobby their dogs can enjoy with them! In recent years, the official Breed Club in Germany has changed the sport’s name to IPO, and most recently IGP. With the amount of “oopsie” litters filling the shelters between backyard breeders, stray dogs, etc., these dogs are produced with specific working homes in mind, and they usually go to either actively participating Schutzhund homes, or to police/k9 training/Search and Rescue programs around the world. Along with health testing to prevent known diseases in their dogs’ progeny that we already know the breed is prone to, (the bare minimum of which includes hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia, and Degenerative Myelopathy, among others,)  the responsible breeders in the German Shepherd Dog community still strictly adhere to the rule of using Schutzhund titles as a bare-minimum requirement before even considering a dog for breeding.<br>In order to achieve a Schutzhund title, </p>
