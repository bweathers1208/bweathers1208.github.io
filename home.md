# About Me

I'm Bri. My hometown is in Georgia, and I moved to Oklahoma as a military spouse. I have two dogs and a cat, and dog training is one of my hobbies.
Currently I'm a bartender by trade, but clearly that's changing.

# Goals

My goal is to completely change my career path into being a full-time website coder/programmer, and eventually work my way up in the industry to be a web developer.
Currently I'm more drawn to front-end stuff, but having barely begun to understand what the various avenues are I may change that in the future.
A goal while I'm in the class is to completely immerse myself in the coding world the way I did in the dog world.
