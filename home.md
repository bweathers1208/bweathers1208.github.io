<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Bri. My hometown is in Georgia, and I moved to Oklahoma as a military spouse. I have two dogs and a cat, and <a href="http://www.germanshepherddog.com" target="_blank">dog training</a> is one of my main hobbies.<br>Currently I'm a bartender by trade, but clearly that's changing.</p>

  <h1>Goals</h1>
<p>My goal is to completely change my career path into being a full-time website coder/programmer, and eventually work my way up in the industry to be a web developer.
Currently I'm more drawn to front-end stuff, but having barely begun to understand what the various avenues are I may change that in the future.<br>My first goal while I'm in the class is to completely immerse myself in the coding world the way I did in the dog world, so that it becomes habit to talk and think about these things instead of being a chore I remind myself to do.</p>
