        <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>So obviously my name is Bri, and my dogs are the center of my universe. There's no hiding it, I've come to terms with being "that girl." It's cool, it's fine, it's whatever. I'm from Augusta, GA-- yep, the land of the Master's, and -shameless plug- if anyone knows where I can find boiled peanuts in Oklahoma I will be your best friend forever! I've been a bartender for going on 10 years now, so I do pride myself on thinking independently, prioritizing my tasks and always doing my best to stay invested in my own improvement. No matter the industry, I have a high standard for effort, so until I enrolled in the Ctrl+Shift Code School, I was participating in a program to become a Certified Bourbon Steward through the Stave & Thief training program available online.</p><br>
          <h1>Goals</h1>
          <p>My goal is to completely change my career path into being a full-time website coder/programmer, and eventually work my way up in the industry to be a web developer.
          Currently I'm more drawn to front-end stuff, but having barely begun to understand what the various avenues are I may change that in the future. My first goal while I'm in the class is to completely immerse myself in the coding world the way I did in the dog world, so that it becomes habit to talk and think about these things instead of being a chore I remind myself to do.</p>
